# ENIT Campus Navigation App

## Versioning

The app uses a simple versioning system based on a `version.txt` file.  
This version number is automatically displayed in the app UI (top left corner).

### Purpose

- The `version.txt` stores a plain integer version number.
- It is used to track which build or deployment version is currently running.
- It is intentionally stored in Git â€” **do not delete this file**.
- The version number is incremented manually or via script.

### Automatic version increment

You can use the following shell script to automatically increment the version number:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

VERSION_FILE="DigitalTwin/version.txt"

# Read current version
version=$(cat "$VERSION_FILE")

# Increment version
new_version=$((version + 1))

# Write new version to file
echo "$new_version" > "$VERSION_FILE"

# Add the file to Git index
git add "$VERSION_FILE"

# Output new version
echo "Version updated to $new_version"
